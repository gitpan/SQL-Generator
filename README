MODULE
	SQL::Generator (Readme)

DESCRIPTION

	With SQL::Generator you can easily (and very flexibly) construct / generate sql-statements.
	As a rookie, you are used to write thousands of sprintf`s every time you need a statement (i.e.for DBI). Later you start
	writing your own functions for every statement and every sql-dialect (RDBMS use to have their own dialect
	extending the general SQL standard). This SQL::Generator module is an approach to have a
	flexible abstraction above the statement generation, which makes it easy to implement
	in your perl code.
